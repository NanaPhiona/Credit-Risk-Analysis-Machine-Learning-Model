# Credit-Risk-Analysis-Machine-Learning-Model
Credit Default Prediction using Responsible Machine Learning A data analytics and machine learning project focused on predicting credit default risk while prioritizing fairness, interpretability, and ethical AI practices.

### Credit Default Prediction – Responsible AI Approach
Project Overview
This project explores credit default prediction using machine learning, with a strong emphasis on fairness, interpretability, and responsible AI.
Rather than optimizing accuracy alone, the goal was to build a model that makes reliable predictions without disadvantaging demographic groups.

#### Problem Statement
Financial institutions need accurate credit risk models, but poorly designed models can unintentionally introduce bias.
This project evaluates how demographic features affect model performance and demonstrates how fairness-aware design improves trust without sacrificing accuracy.

#### Dataset
The dataset contains customer financial behavior and demographic attributes, including:
Credit payment history
Billing and repayment behavior
Demographic variables (gender, education, marital status)

#### Methodology
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Logistic Regression modeling
Bias analysis across demographic groups
Feature re-evaluation and removal of biased attributes
Model re-training and performance comparison

#### Key Results
Accuracy: 0.705
ROC-AUC: 0.75
Removing demographic variables preserved performance while improving:
Fairness
Interpretability
Compliance with ethical credit modeling principles

#### Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

#### Key Takeaway
Responsible AI is not about limiting performance — it’s about building models that are fair, transparent, and trustworthy.
